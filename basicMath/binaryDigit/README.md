# 191. Number of 1 Bits
Easy
> Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

* Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

* Explanation:<br>

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

* Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1

# 338. Counting Bits

> Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 105
