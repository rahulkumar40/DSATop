# 📌 Sort Records Using Comparator in Java

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to **sort a list of custom objects (`Record`)** in Java using the **Comparator interface**.
The records are sorted based on:

1. **Marks (Descending order)**
2. **Name (Ascending order)** when marks are the same

This approach is commonly used in **real-world applications** like ranking systems, student result management, and interview problems.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a list of student records containing:

- `id`
- `name`
- `marks`

Sort the records:

- First by **marks (highest first)**
- If marks are equal, then by **name (alphabetically)**

---

## 🏗️ Data Model

Each record is represented using a custom `Record` class with:

- Constructor for initialization
- `toString()` method for formatted output

---

## ⚙️ Approach

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Create a `Record` class**

   - Holds `id`, `name`, and `marks`
   - Overrides `toString()` for readable output

2. **Store records in a `List`**

   - Uses `ArrayList` for dynamic storage

3. **Sort using `Comparator`**

   - Compare marks in **descending order**
   - If marks are equal, compare names in **ascending order**

4. **Print the sorted records**

---

## 🔍 Sorting Logic Explained

### Comparator Rule

```text
IF marks are different
    Sort by marks (descending)
ELSE
    Sort by name (ascending)
```

### Why this works?

- Ensures **higher-scoring students appear first**
- Maintains **alphabetical order** for students with the same marks

---

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Id : 1 | Name : Vivek  | Marks : 85
Id : 2 | Name : Anshu  | Marks : 84
Id : 3 | Name : Pankaj | Marks : 82
Id : 5 | Name : Pawan  | Marks : 82
Id : 4 | Name : Kumar  | Marks : 75
Id : 6 | Name : Kundan | Marks : 75
```

## 💡 Key Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- `Comparator` Interface
- Lambda Expressions
- Collections Framework
- Custom Sorting Logic

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Student result ranking systems
- Leaderboards
- Employee performance sorting
- Interview & coding test problems

---

## 🧠 Interview Explanation (Short & Crisp)

> “I sorted the records using a Comparator.
> First, records are ordered by marks in descending order.
> If two students have the same marks, they are sorted by name in ascending order.”

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add sorting by multiple fields dynamically
- Use Java Stream API
- Make fields private and use getters
- Read data from file or database

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project showcases **clean and efficient sorting of custom objects in Java**, following industry-standard practices and interview-ready logic.
